Hey there!

I'm [Giacomo Marciani]({{< ref "about.md" >}}). I'm a full-cycle Software Engineer at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) 
with 6+ years of experience in [Cloud Computing](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) 
and [High Performance Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing).

Originally from [Rome](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wJRmKz7ZHA5sCB6w9), I currently live in [Cagliari](https://maps.app.goo.gl/X6rbEdPpEeEEVaFJ6) with my wife and three wonderful kids.

In my role, I cover the product lifecycle end to end; from the design, reviews and implementation, to security, devops and oncall.

More than anything else, what makes me a good engineer and a good leader is that I love software and the people behind it.

I'm using this website to blog about my learnings in software and leadership.
