Hi, my name is Giacomo Marciani.

I am a passionate software engineer with experience in Cloud Computing and High Performance Computing.
More than anything else, what makes me a good engineer and a good leader is that I love building innovative software products with high standard architectures, code and devops in a challenging context.
I put my proactivity and enthusiasm in every aspect of my daily job and I love to team up with people who want to solve complex technical challenges like me.

I've always been looking for an international company that aims to lead technological innovation on a large scale, pursuing excellence with its products; while making me able to test, enhance and extend my personal qualities and technical knowledge.

I found it in Amazon Web Services.
