Hey there!

I'm [Giacomo Marciani]({{< ref "about.md" >}}), I am a full-cycle Software Engineer at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) 
with 6+ years of experience in [Cloud Computing](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) 
and [High Performance Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing).

I come from [Rome](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wJRmKz7ZHA5sCB6w9), 
and I currently live in [Cagliari](https://maps.app.goo.gl/X6rbEdPpEeEEVaFJ6) with my wife and three wonderful kids.

In my role, I cover the product lifecycle end to endêž‰ from the design, reviews and implementation, to security, devops and oncall.
I have an educational background in Software Engineering with a focus on Distributed Systems and Big Data.

More than anything else, what makes me a good engineer and a good leader is that I deeply love my job. 
It excites me to build innovative software products with high standards of efficiency, scalability, 
clean coding/architecturing and effective ops processes.
